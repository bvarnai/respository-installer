# installer - a configuration based repository installer

![CI badge](https://github.com/bvarnai/respository-installer/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

**installer** is a tool to help users to work with multiple *Git* repositories from the initial clone to getting updates.

:bulb: I use the word *project* interchangeably with *repository*

**Where does it fit?**

I worked in a Java development team, we had about 15 repositories. I needed a simple tool which is

- Self-contained, no-deps
- *Git* only (minimal platform specific code)
- Configuration based
- Upgradeable
- Supports development `streams` (for example parallel tooling for java17, java21 etc.)

and **nothing** more.

I looked at existing tools such as Google's [repo](https://github.com/GerritCodeReview/git-repo), but they are much more complicated and usually mixing development workflow tasks which I wanted to keep separately.

## Installation

First, the following environment variables must be set

- `INSTALLER_CONFIG_URL` - URL of the configuration `projects.json`
- `INSTALLER_CONFIG_SCM` - type of SCM (GitHub etc.) used for the configuration

### Supported SCM types

Since the configuration is also branch specific, we need to know how to get a branch from the SCM. This means assembling a URL used by `curl` to get the configuration. The following SCM types are supported:
  - github - GitHub *[default]*
  - bitbucket_server - Bitbucket Enterprise (server/data center)
  - static - Simple HTTP

:warning: This is only used for configuration discovery, you can use any platform later for your projects

#### GitHub

To access raw content, such as downloading a file, GitHub's URL format is the following:

```
https://#token#@raw.githubusercontent.com/<user or organization>/<repo name>/#branch#/<path to file>/<file name>
```
**installer** uses the `##` markers to insert and assemble the correct URL

- `#token#` is replaced with `INSTALLER_CONFIG_TOKEN` environment variable which holds your *Personal access token* or PAT. To create PAT follow the offical guide [Creating a personal access token (classic)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic)
- `#branch#` is replaced with the currect branch (this done automatically)

:bulb: Token is only needed for private repositories. Make sure you set `repo` scope (and nothing more) when creating the PAT
![github-pat](docs/github-pat.png)

For example, using your private repositories would need the following settings:
```
export INSTALLER_CONFIG_URL=https://#token#@raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/#branch#/projects.json
export INSTALLER_CONFIG_TOKEN=1bacnotmyrealtoken123beefbea
```

#### BitBucket Enterprise

Since Bitbucket uses the URL's query string to specify the branch, there is no need to use markers. The format is the following:

```
https://<server url>/projects/<project name>/repos/<repo name>/raw/<path to file>/<file name>?<branch>
```

You can copy&paste the URL from BitBucket's web UI, for example
```
export INSTALLER_CONFIG_URL=https://contoso/projects/project/repos/repo/raw/projects.json
export INSTALLER_CONFIG_SCM=bitbucket_server
```

:warning: Only public repositories are supported at this time, I had no time to test with private repositories

#### Simple HTTP

This type is mainly used to testing and it's very similar to GitHub's format.

:memo: You can set these variables in `~/.profile` or `~/.bashrc` to make them permanent

Next get the **installer** with `curl` for the first time

```bash
curl -L $INSTALLER_SELF_URL -o installer.sh && chmod +x installer.sh
```

Finally run **installer** in the current working directory.

```bash
./installer.sh
```
:tada: Once downloaded **installer** will upgrade itself, no need to run `curl` again.

### Prerequisites

Following tools are required and must be installed
  - `git`
  - `curl`
  - `sed`
  - `bash` >= 4.0.0

:warning: [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) is downloaded by **installer** to bootstrap itself if not available. This step is platform specific

Supported platforms
- Linux amd64
- Windows amd64
  - [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) 64 bit version
    - Tested with 2.41.0+

## Configuration

### Workspace explained

Workspace is the directory where your repositories/projects are installed. **installer** runs from the workspace root and projects in the configuration
are specified *relative* to this directory.

Example layout with `installer.sh` present
```
workspace-root
  .installer
  project1
  project2
  subfolder/project3
  installer.sh
```

:memo: `.installer` directory is a "temp" directory used to store the configuration and other dependencies such as `jq`

### Configuration file

The configuration file is called `projects.json` and it's downloaded using the `INSTALLER_CONFIG_URL` environment variable. It contains information about all your projects, including setup instructions.

```json
{
  "bootstrap": "myproject",
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "myproject",
      "category": "generic",
      "default": "true",
      "urls": {
        "fetch": "https://github.com/johndoe/myproject.git",
        "push": "git@github.com:johndoe/myproject.git"
      },
      "options": {
        "clone": "--depth 1"
      },
      "configuration": [
        "core.autocrlf false",
        "core.safecrlf false"
      ],
      "branch": "master",
      "update": "true",
      "doLast": [
        "./do_something.sh"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

:memo: Additional notes
- A bootstrap project is simply a project that is always installed
- :warning: A bootstrap project must be set to default `default==true` as well
- Different `fetch` and `push` URLs can be used to reduce load in *Git* hosting server, for example use `https` for `fetch` and `ssh` for `push`
- Setting `update==false` means repositories are fetched but not updated. This is desirable for development projects, so working branches are felt unchanged
- :warning: Setting `update==true` means repositories are fetched, reset and updated. This also means the branch will be switched to the default branch

:bulb: You can use a bootstap project to host your DevOps scripts etc. for example doLast scripts

## Usage

### Command reference

Command syntaxÂ is the following:

```bash
./installer.sh [options] [<command>] [arguments]
```

Optional elements are shown in brackets []. For example, command may take a list of projects as an argument.

#### Options

- `-y, --yes` - skip user prompts
- `--link` - use symlinks to target directory
- `--branch` - overrides `branch` setting in configuration
- `--stream` - specifies the `stream` of the configuration
- `--git-quiet` - pass quite to git commands (not everything is suppressed)

#### Options for development/testing

- `--skip-self-update` - skip the script update step
- `--use-local-config` - use a local configuration file

##### Link mode

In some cases, you don't want to have a fresh clone of a project to save some time. For example *Jenkins* multibanch pipeline would create a new workspace and make a fresh clone in using **installer**. This is where `link` mode can help.

Let see an example *Jenkinsfile*

```groovy
pipeline {

    environment {

        // installer configuration
        INSTALLER_SELF_URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bvarnai/respository-installer/main/src/installer.sh'
        INSTALLER_CONFIG_URL = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johndoe/myproject/main/cfg/projects.json'

        // use a directory outside of job's workspace
        SHARED_WORKSPACE = "${WORKSPACE}/../shared_workspace"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Prepare workspace') {
            steps {
                // install dependencies
                sh '''
                mkdir -p ${SHARED_WORKSPACE}

                curl -s -o installer.sh -L ${INSTALLER_SELF_URL} && chmod +x installer.sh
                ./installer.sh --yes --link ${SHARED_WORKSPACE} myproject1 myproject2
                '''
            }
        }
        stage ('Next') {
            steps {
              ...
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This will create symlinks `myproject1` and `myproject2` in the job's workspace, pointing to `../shared_workspace/myproject1` and `../shared_workspace/myproject2` directories respectively.

:warning: If you have multiple executors, parallel jobs might be running on the same shared workspace directory. This can be prevented by using the `EXECUTOR_NUMBER` variable

```groovy
SHARED_WORKSPACE = "${WORKSPACE}/../shared_workspace/${EXECUTOR_NUMBER}"
```
